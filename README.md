Hey y'all! I figured hosting this on Github would be useful so that whenever I update the file, I don't have to re-send it to the discord.

In terms of how to download it yourself, if you're not familiar with Github, just click on the green button that says "Code", then click "Download as Zip" from the dropdown menu.
